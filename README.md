# Numerical Methods in Rust

> from May-June in 2025.

Practice with Rust by implementing some numerical methods in it (preferably from scratch, then maybe with libraries), while also refreshing up on a bit of theory. This will be constrained to a 6-week period.

Some learning outcomes along the way:
- get a better feel of Rust
- become more familiar with computation and visualization libs (equivalents of matplotlib, numpy, scipy, etc.) and do one cool visualization
- read some papers and remember what my degree was

**Bonus points**:
- learn multiprocessing, multi-threading, and/or that "tokio" thing somehow

## Outline

> This *might* be a bit optimistic...

| Week no. | Week | Topic |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | 5/12 - 5/18 | Riemann summation, differentiation |
| 2 | 5/19 - 5/25 | Taylor series, Euler's method, RK4 |
| 3 | 5/26 - 6/1 | CORDIC and sqrt (without using rust's square root algorithm) |
| 4 | 6/2 - 6/8 | Gierer Meinhardt system. This is where you might want to do some visualizing. |
| 5 | 6/9 - 6/15 | Navier-Stokes equations (pt. 1) |
| 6 | 6/16 - 6/22 | Navier-Stokes equations (pt. 2) |

I don't actually remember what the NS equations were about. Guess we'll find out on 6/9! Or maybe we can try something else, like molecular dynamics or some interesting differential equation.

I kind of want to put in some ML, but also I don't want to gather data...

## Week 1 - Differentiation and Integration
Basic: implement a function differentiator and integrator.
