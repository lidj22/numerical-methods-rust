# Week 4

## Rust

Let's do these things:
- lifetimes
- what rust crates are there for plotting and animating
- simulate one equation using maybe finite difference methods

## Differential Equations

Let's just focus on these concepts:
- eigenvalue problems
- separation of variables
- finite difference methods

Books:

- [Elementary Differential Equations](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Differential_Equations/Elementary_Differential_Equations_with_Boundary_Value_Problems_(Trench))
- [The finite difference method](https://www.ljll.fr/frey/cours/UdC/ma691/ma691_ch6.pdf)
